    "The Bigram Model estimates the probability of a word given the one before it, allowing us to model word dependencies and improve accuracy over the Unigram Model. To handle sparsity and zero probabilities, we use Laplace smoothing.\n",

    "This model brings us closer to real-world text generation and ranking but can still struggle with long-range dependencies, which more advanced models like trigrams or neural LMs aim to solve.\n"
